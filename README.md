# LightbulbShutter
In the Instirute of Physics our department works with a photo-electrochemical device for measurement of the cataylsts photo-activity. The device consists of the elecrochemical cell, potentiostat and lightbulb with a defined optical spectrum. Our colegue asked me to automate the lightbulb shutter which was previously operated manualy. The goal was to make the electical device for manipuation with a step motor, which was responsible for closing/opening bulb shutter during a given period of time at some given frequency and off/on time. The device was connected via the usb cable to the computer and contolled by the program written in C#(WPF).

## Highlights
* Hardware soldering and programming.
* First experiments with WPF.
* Serial port communication.
* Abuse of events instead of MVVM implementation.

## Used frameworks and programming languages
C#(WPF), Arduino C
